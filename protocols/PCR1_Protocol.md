**Overall Steps**

1. Make Master Mix
2. First Amplification
3. 2% Agarose Gel to Check for Amplification



##1. Make Master

**Materials:**

- Molecular grade water
- Bioline 2x MyTaq Mix
- ITS2 Forward and Reverse primers diluted to 10 uM


**Steps:**

- Thaw materials and DNA on ice for 40-60 mins
- Vortex and spine down materials
- Combine materials in 2 mL tube according to below table, vortex and spin down
- If working with multiple sets of strip tubes, divide Master Mix from 2 mL tube into a new strip tube to use multichannel

Master Mix:

| Component                   | Volume for 1 rxn  |
|-----------------------------|-------------------|
| 2x MyTaq Mix                | 25.0 uL           |
| Molecular Water             | 18.0 uL           |
| ITS2 Primer Forward (10 uM) | 2.0  uL           |
| ITS2 Primer Reverse (10 uM) | 2.0  uL           |



##2. First Amplification

**Materials:**

- DNA diluted to 10 ng/uL
- Strip tubes - 3 tubes / sample
  ex: if running 8 samples you will need 3, 8 tube 0.1 mL strip tubes
- Master Mix generated in Step 1
- Multichannel pipette

** Steps:**

- Add 47 uL of Master Mix to strip 1 of every set of three strip tubes
- Add 3uL of DNA for each sample to strip 1
  in BLANK samples, 3 uL of Molecular Grade water
- Vortex and spin down strip 1
- Move 16.67 uL of solution from strip 1 to strip 2 and strip 3 for each sample so each tube contained about 16.6 uL
  See example below
- Spin down strip tubes to remove any bubbles
- Thermocycle samples set to

Thermocycler Settings:

| Cycles | Time   | Temp |
|--------|--------|------|
| 1 	   | 3 min  | 95°  |
| 35     | 30 sec | 95°  |
|        | 30 sec | 52°  |
|        | 30 sec | 72°  |
| 1      | 5 min  | 72°  |
| 1      | ∞ min  | 4°   |

**Example Strip Tube Set Up:**
Strip Tube Set Up:

| Strip (replicate) Number | A     | B     | C      | D     | E     | F      | G     | H      |
|--------------------------|-------|-------|--------|-------|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| 1                        | 0CX4  | 0CX5  | 0GT1   | 0GT3  | 0GT5  | 1GT36  | 1GT37 | 1GT42  |
| 2                        | 0CX4  | 0CX5  | 0GT1   | 0GT3  | 0GT5  | 1GT36  | 1GT37 | 1GT42  |
| 3                        | 0CX4  | 0CX5  | 0GT1   | 0GT3  | 0GT5  | 1GT36  | 1GT37 | 1GT42  |
| 4                        | 1GT43 | 2CX10 | 2CX12  | 2CX13 | 2CX8  | 2GT10  | 2GT3  | 2GT38  |
| 5                        | 1GT43 | 2CX10 | 2CX12  | 2CX13 | 2CX8  | 2GT10  | 2GT3  | 2GT38  |
| 6                        | 1GT43 | 2CX10 | 2CX12  | 2CX13 | 2CX8  | 2GT10  | 2GT3  | 2GT38  |



##3. 2% Agarose Gel to Check for Amplification

**Materials:**

- Agarose
- New 1X TAE Buffer
- GelGreen
- 1 KB Plus DNA Ladder
- Loading Dye
- Parafilm

**Steps:**

- Make gel
    - Small box: 75 mL new 1X TAE and 1.5g Agarose
    - Medium box: 100 mL new TAE and 2g Agarose
    - Large box:
  - Use weigh boat to measure agarose and graduated cylinder to measure TAE
  - Combine into Erlenmeyer flask, swirl to mix, and place a scrunched Kimwipe in the mouth of the flask
  - Microwave for 1+ min, stopping every 20 sec to swirl flask. Use glove as glass gets hot. Continue adding time until no flakes remain in the mixture
  - Add 1 uL GelGreen
  - Set up gel mold
  - Allow mixture to cool for 5 min before pouring into mold and adding combs
  - Allow gel to set for 30-60 min
- Once gel has hardened remove combs, orient gel so wells are at the top of the tray, and pour enough used 1X TAE to reach the fill line in the box
- Load 4 uL of 1KB Plus DNA ladder into the first and last well of every row
- On Parafilm, make 2 uL dot of loading dye for every sample
- Add 5 uL of DNA to each dot, pipetting up and down 5 times to mix. Then set pipette to 7 uL to uptake all liquid
- Load DNA and Loading Dye into gel wells
- Place lid on gel box making sure the red cord sits at the bottom end of the gel ("Run to Red")
- Run gel for 60 min at 100 volts and 400 amps
- Remove Gel from tray and place on imager, using phone to take a picture through the box
- Dispose of gel in SAA for gel waste
- Pour leftover TAE into used TAE container
- Rinse box, bomb and flasks in DI type2 water
- Wipe imager with Kimwipe and DI type2
- Annotate gel image
