[Zymo Quick-DNA Mini-Prep Plus Kit](https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_d4068_d4069_quick-dna_miniprep_plus_kit.pdf)


## <a name="reagent"></a> **Reagent Preparation**
- Add 1,040 uL Proteinase  storage buffer to the Proteinase K solid tube. Vortex to mix. Store at -20C after mixing 
- Warm elution buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl) at 70C 
- Prepare tubes for Zymo extraction and clean and concentrate kit 
    - 5x microcentrifuge tubes
    - 3x colelction tube
    - 2x spin columns 
    - 1 or 2x qbit tubes depending on if you will qbit uncleaned DNA 


## <a name="sample"></a> **Sample Processing**
1. Thaw proteinase K 
2. Using forceps, take a fin clip from the envelope and place (< 25 mg) into microcentrifuge tube 
3. To the tube add 
    - 190 uL molecular water
    - 190 uL Solid Tissue Buffer (Blue)
    - 20 uL Proteinase K
4. Vortex for 10-15 seconds
5. Incubate at 55C and 400rpm for 2 hrs. After 2 hrs check to see if the tissue is solubized. If it is proceed to step 7, if it is not, proceed to step 5. 
7. If the tissue is not solubized or starting to break down, move the liquid and tissue from the microcentrifuge tube to a ceramic bead tube and place in the tissue lyser for 5 mins. After centrifuge for (see julianes version for soil)
8. To remove any insoluable debris centrifuge at 13,000 x g for 1 minute. Transfer the upper aqueous supernatant to a clean microcentrifuge tube, avoiding the pellet and lipid layer

Remove Qbit reagents from the fridge to thaw 

9. Add 2 volumes (1 vol = amount of supernatant from step 6) of Genomic Binding Buffer to the supernatant. Vortex for 10-15 seconds
10. Transfer 750 uL of the mixture to a Zymo-Spin llC-XLR Collumn in a Collection Tube. Centrifuge at 13,000 x g for 1 minute. Discard the flow through and collection tube
11. Repeat step 8 until all mixture has been used
12. Add 400 uL DNA Pre-Wash Buffer to the spin column in a new collection tube. Centrifuge at 13,000 x g for 1 minute. Discard the flow through
13. Add 700 uL of g-DNA Wash Buffer to the spin column. Centrifuge at 13,000 x g for 1 minute. Discard the flow through 
14. Add 200 uL g-DNA Wash Buffer to the spin column. Centrifuge at 13,000 x g for 1 minute. Discard the flow through and collection tube
15. Transfer the spin column to a clean microcentrifuge tube. Add 50 uL DNA elution Buffer directly on the matrix. Incubate for 5 minutes at room temperature, then centrifuge at 13,000 x g for 1 minute to elute DNA. 
16. Quantify on Qbit and store at -20C
