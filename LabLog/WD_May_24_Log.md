## <a name="goals"></a> **May Goals**

April goals I finished: 
- QC_WGS
    - [] SNP filtering for QC_WGS mt-DNA
    - [] SNP filtering for QC_WGS psuedo reference 
    - [x] Backup raw seqs to gdrive
- Octo_rest
    - [] Finish JG edits 
- MGPR21
    - [] CHL for all samples 
    - [] Send data and scripts to MG if Rachel is not finished with wax dipping 
    - [] Give Rachel new wax dipping sheet so it is easier to code with 
- Lab 
    - [] Inventory post PCR freezer 
    - [] Create exit google form for the lab 
    - [] Continue mentoring Haley 

May goals: 
- Octo_rest
    - [] loglm() 
    - [] finish JG edits 
- Eflex-trans-WGS 
    - [] build libraries 
- MGPR21
    - [] CHL for all samples 
- TLAP
    - [] conference prep 

## <a name="log"></a> **Daily Logs**

## May 23
- Cleaned Eflx-trans-WGS DNA. Julie and I spent the morning cleaning the Eflx-trans-WGS samples that have failed lib prep, and the remaining deep samples with the Zymo Clean and Concentrate kit. Matias has found that removing small fragments from the DNA increases the success of lib prep amplification. 
- Diluted remaining Eflx-trans-WGS samples to 0.5 ng/uL

## May 22 
- Eflx-trans-WGS libraries. I trained Juliane in how to do the library prep. We did 11 samples and ended with 5/11 successfull libraries. We started with the original DNA, quantified, diluted, and then did the lib prep. I chatted with Carlos and the plan movign forward is to clean the original DNA to try and improve amplification quality. The deep libraries seem to not work as well as the shallow libraries

## May 21
TLAP Quads presentation for temperate coral conference. I finished the slides and wrote blurbs for all of the slides.

## May 20
- TLAP Quads presentation. I had a meeting with TL today at GSO where we went over all of my slides, decided on which graphs to use, and how to frame the story of the data for the talk. I'm getting really exctied for the presentation  

## May 17 
Personal day 

## May 16 
- Eflex-trans-WGS lib prep for 16 samples 
- ![](https://github.com/wdunster/WDPrada_Lab_Notebook/blob/main/images/Eflex-trans-WGS_Lib3.png)
- TLAP Quads presentation

## May 15 
- MS edits 
- TLAP Quads presentation

## May 14
- Eflex-trans-WGS dilutions for 20 samples 
- MS edits 

## May 13
- Eflex-trans-WGS lib prep

## May 3 
- Octo_rest loglm()
- Qbit Eflex-trans_WGS DNA 

## May 1 
- Inventory eDNA supplies with Juliane. We dedicated bench 1, eppendorf pipettes, and a set of racks (blue) for eDNA. I autoclaved all racks with the grav20 program 
- Qbit Eflex-trans-WGS DNA
