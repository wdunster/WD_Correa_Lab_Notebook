- Lab 
    - Inventory Organismal side of the lab

Dec goals I did not finish: 
- QC_WGS
    - have libraries for 15 samples from BVI, FL, and PR-F. These will hopefully be sent to sequencing by the end of Dec and if not in early Jan
    - I will have these done by Jan 15
- Lab 
    - Inventory Prada freezers and post PCR fridges

Jan goals: 
- QC_WGS
    - [x] Libraries ready for sequecning by 01/15
    - [ ] Start lookking at the code you will need for these sequences and prep an RMD file
- Octo_Rest
    - [x] Have a finished product for Carlos to edit by 01/09
- Lab 
    - Inventory post PCR freezers
    - Create an exit google form for the lab to know where peoples samples are and when they can be disposed of

## Jan 30 
- Edits for TLAP
    - Do some redaing to fill in holes 
    - Modeling questions 

## Jan 29
- QC_WGS extraction 19 
    - Results were good and all but 2 samples had concentations around 10+ ng/uL with some samples as high as 30 ng/uL 
    - I did a 5 hr incubation and larger tissue segments than with the original extractions for this project 
- Reading for pop gen 

## Jan 26
- Reading for TLAP edits next week  

## Jan 25
- TLPR21 Protein redo assay for 8 samples. This served as a practice run for the protein assay
  Things to note: 
    - The plate reader doe not have to input a plate map
    - BSA reagent A is the large bottle and reagent B is the small blue bottle 
    - After recieving the plate reader info you download a txt file and upload this to the Rscript TL provided 
- Purchase orders for eppendorf centrifuge lid seal 
- Cleaned all -80*C freezers 
- JP Pop Gen class 

## Jan 23 
- TLAP read Sharp et al 2017 to prep for TL manuscript edits
- Searched for TLPR21 host-PTAC redo samples and created a new box for them 
- Prepped sheets for TLPR21 protein redo as a practice for MGPR21

Prada Meeting Notes: 
- Meeting time moved to 10am 
- QC_WGS
    - Send plastic bin link to Carlos
    - Finish reading papers from Matias about lcWGS
    - Read about Fastp
    - Schedule a meeting with Matias to learn about Staks and dDocent
- Octo_rest
    - Journal to format for = Marine Ecology or Frotiers (ideally Front)
    - Add predation and positive growth to the paper 
    - Message Carlos at the begining of next week to edit the manuscript 
- MGPR21
    - Continue with protein assays 


## Jan 22

- Organized weekly reading

## Jan 16
- QC_WGS pooled libraries into 2 pools (A = [Lib] > 6; B = [Lib] < 6) 
- Labeled tubes for MGPR21

## Jan 15
- Holiday
- Created Genohub sample manifest

## Jan 12
- Finished a rough draft of octo_rest manuscript 
- Read Lou et al. 2020 -- about lcWGS proccess, pros, and analysis
