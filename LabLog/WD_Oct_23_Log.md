## <a name="log"></a> **Daily Logs**

### Oct 31
- 8:00am - 4:00pm (8hrs)
- Octo_restoration coding 
    - 
- Prada Meeting Notes and Things to do Next Week: 
    - 16s
        - download sequences 
        - Run QC report
        - Trim adapters (Janet left them on so we coudl look for primer dimer)
        - Blast to match 16s data to see if bacterial sequences 
        - Re-read the whole plate because Janet found pooling issues (different concentrations of samples) so the DNA concentration values from the first plate read must not be accurate. However we are going to wait to do this until we hear back from GenoHub
    - QC_WGS
        - Dilute all extractions in Tris. Carlos believes it will be easier to dilute to 5 ng/ul and then make a dilution from that. 
        - Chat with Matias about Tape Station protocol
        - Keep going with extractions and try to scale up the process. Leave the Florida samples for last because there is such a small amount of tissue from the non-lethal sampling techniques
        - Send carlos an Amazon link for a large plastic bin to keep WC_WGS boxes in. 
    - Octo_Rest
        - G-test of independence and post hoc for dead samples
        - Expect to see an even ratio 
        - Compare nail  and no nail survival using a Chi-Sqr


### Oct 30
- 8:00am to 5:00pm
- QC_WGS extraction 7 for BVI-14 thro BVI-17
- Aliquotted reagents for Nextera Library Prep (Tris, Molec Water, Beads, NT)

### Oct 27
- 8:00am to 10:30am and 12:00pm to 5:00pm
- QC_WGS Diltuion 1 for BVI-1 thro BVI-13


### Oct 26 
- 8:00 am - 4:00pm 
- Extraction 6 for BVI-10 thro BVI-13
    - Extractions were largely successful with all samples besides two having good qbit values
    - I think I used to large of pieces of tissue
    - The protocol is moving smoother each time which is exciting
- Worked on lab inventory and mapping out our spaces and equipment layout
- Arranged for Hazardous Waste removal of chemical fume hood SAA


### Oct 24
- 8:00am - 5:00pm 
- Extraction 5 for BVI-1 through BVI-6

### Oct 23
- 8:00am - 6:30 pm
- TL_RI23 AAUS quardat sampling 
- Octo_Restoration coding 
    - updated figures 1 and 2 
    - Chi-sqr analysis of attachement
    - Graphed nails linear extension 
- Planning extractions for the week 
    - Tuesday
        - extract BVI 1-6 for DS and DMSO
        - 13 samples total
        - Timing
            - start 8am  
            - incubating by 9am 
            - 9-2 incubate (5 hrs)
            - Extract 2-3ish pm 
    - Thursday
        - extract BVI 7-12 DS and DMSO
        - 13 samples
        - Timing
            - start 7am 
            - incubating 8-1pm (5 hrs)
            - extract 1-3pm 

### Oct 20
- 8:00am - 4:30pm
- QC_WGS extraction 4. I did not finish this extraction because I made mistake that resulted in terminating the extraction
- Created documents for freezer maintenance and reviewed freezer manuals for instructions
- Finished QC_WGS cryovial boxes


### Oct 19
- 8:00 am - 4:30 pm 
- QC_WGS extraction 3
- The extraction went well with the new modification. I am going to leave them to incubate for 5 hrs instead of 3.5 tomorrow and hope for higher yields of DNA. I am still seeing an avg 10 ng/uL and ideally would like 15-20 ng/uL. The protocol gets smoother every time though!

### Oct 17
- QC_WGS Extraction 2

### OCT 16 
- QC_WGS Extraction 2 prep 

### Oct 15
- QC_WGS extraction 1

### Oct 14 
- QC_WGS Extraction 1 prep 

### Oct 12
- 8:00am - 4:00pm
- Diving with Taylor
- Inventory and labeling lab spaces


### Oct 10
- 7:45am - 3:45pm
- Octo_rest writing (2 hrs)
- Weekly meeting with Carlos 
    - Howie email takeaway = EF is more flexible and it depends on the location of breakage
    - G test to expand on chi square analysis of discrete data 
    - Nails
- Aliquoted new Omega Mollusc DNA extraction kit reagents. Carlos decided to use the new kit instead of the old one. I made aliquots for everything except the Chloroform:isoamyl which I will aliquot in the fume hood on Thursday. 

### Oct 09
- 7:30am - 1:30pm
- TL_RI23 cage extraction

### Oct 06
- 8:00am - 6:15pm (minus 1 hr off campus)
- Inventoried all drawers and added purchasing info to the Prada Lab inventory. Things are starting to come together though I still have some work to do on labeling all drawers and updating the map on sheets.

### Oct 05
- 7:45am - 3:45pm
- Labeled and filled cryo vials for TL_RI23 extraction next week. Store vials on shelf DS1
- Re diluted and pooled 10 samples for Raker_OFAV_16s amplification. Genohub (NextSeq) could not sequence these samples. I brought the 10 to Janet at URI sequencing to see if they can be sequenced on MySeq
- Jill showed me how to use VS code to connetc to GitHub as I had diverged the branches between my RStudio terminal and GitHub. Everything seems fixed now
- Reviewed and excepted GRFP edits from GWC
- Started organismal inventory
