    - Inventory Prada fridges and freezers 

## <a name="log"></a> **Daily Logs**

### Nov 30 
- QC_WGS extraction 11
- Labeled tubes for TL_AP
    - Moving forward if I need things to do I can start to process all TL_AP Round 1 (BC) samples
    - Changes to aliquot protocol 
        - Only 3 tubes 
        - Only DI 
        - 1 mL to Sym PTAC and CHL tubes. Then move both supernatans to the Host PTAC tube
    - If i need addional things to do I can also help process Matias's samples once Hana-Lei has finished airbrushing 

### Nov 28 
- QC_WGS extraction 10 - see extraction log for results. The extraction went well but I didn't see any advantage to the overnight incubation so I think I will continue with a few hour incubation 
- Organized post-pcr side of lab 
- Prada meeting
    - QC_WGS
        - Need to do extraction from FL samples on Thurs this week because the contract group wants to know if we can get good DNA from 3 locations by the end of the year
        - Aiming for 15 libraries from each location 
    - Octo_rest
        - Keep writing. Make sure to write in an engaging, active voice that will likely be in the first person. You want to tell a story
        - Revise results, methods, and intro to change writing style 
        - Start writing discussion and researching connections between data and real world 

### Nov 27
- Finished KY and CU boxes for QC_WGS
- Prepped QC_WGS extraction 10 for an overnight incubation 

### Nov 21
- Completed MX QC_WGS box and started labeling boxes for KY and CU
- Weekly Prada meeting
    - Raker_16s
        - Done for now -- CR will take point from here
        - The second set of seq for each sample is a single end read with only about 100 reads so were jsut going to ditch it 
    - QC_WGS 
        - Make new boxes (x2 35 samples) for Mexico (MX), Caymen Islands (KY), and Cuba (CU)
        - Add PR to sample name for all of Diana's samples 
        - Continue with libraries. We want ~15 libraries per location which means I need to clean and put ~20 samples through lib prep 
        - Buy open top baskets from Amazon
        - Finish BVI extractions and add a few samples from FL into it


### Nov 20 
- Organized all lab logs and my planner 
- QC_WGS quantified samples Diana had stored in the -20 that she extracted in 2017 19
 

### Nov 16 
- Ran taxonomy on QUIME to output the taxonomy barplots. It looks like we have bacterial seq which is super exciting! Now I need to go back and do the same thing for the whole dataset (becuase I was working with a small subset previously) and concatenate the two sets of seq I have for each sample (genohub seq every sample twice in order to increase reading depth)

### Nov 15 
- I know I don't work on Wed., but with the Fri. deadline approaching for raker_16s_genohub I coded for 4-5 hours. I finally got metadata and data to upload to QUIME and ran the first part of the program. 

### Nov 14 
- Downloaded sequences directly from Genohub to check if CR copied the wrong seqs

### Nov 13
- Today was supposed to be a payed holiday however TL needed divers and the raker_16s project needed to move forward so I worked today and took Friday Nov 17 off instead
- Diving for TL_RI23. This was our last dive of the season and we did quadrats and measured fragment size using calipers in the 25-35 ft range. 
- Struggled with uploading metadata to QUIME 

### Nov 10 
- Raker_16s sequences came back from genohub and this started the rush to quantify them. Genohub gives 10 days to claim the data. I ran QC reports on Genohub and Janets samples. 

### Nov 09
- Library prep for 8 samples. Matias came and sat while I ran through the protocol but I didn't really have any questions. I feel confident in my ability to do it on my own moving forawrd. 
- Diving with Taylor

### Nov 07
- Quantified extraction 6 on qbit 
- Prepped for lab meeting freezer cleanout 
- Connected to Andromeda and uploaded raker_16s files
- Cleaned freezer in lab meeting. Diana said that I can clean the post PCR -20 and throw out anything from Juliane and all the other students they previously had
- Weekly meeting with Carlos: 
    - QC_WGS
        - Pick DMSO or DS and only extract 1 moving forward 
        - Diana has more samples in freezer F that need to be qbitted 
        - Continue lib prep 
    - Octo_rest
        - Compare the types of death (not nails lmao) with G test
        - Fisher exact test for nail vs no nail
    - Raker_16s
        - QIME or a loaded model in Andromeda for blasting against 16s
        - Fastp should automatically adapter trim
    

### Nov 06
- Extraction 6 for BVI-18 thro BVI-26

### Nov 03
- Library preparation for BVI-1 thro BVI-8 with Matias
- Library info can found in QC_WGS_Library_Prep log
- BVI-3 and BVI-5 did not amplify, all other samples had a good (> 5ng/uL) amplification 

### Nov 02 
- Dive TL_RI23  
- Diluted QC_WGS Extraction 7 
- Generated Nov log and goals
