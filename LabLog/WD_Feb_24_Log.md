## <a name="goals"></a> **February Goals**

Jan goals I finished: 
- QC_WGS
    - [x] Libraries ready for sequecning by 01/15
    - [x] Start lookking at the code you will need for these sequences and prep an RMD file
- Octo_Rest
    - [x] Have a finished product for Carlos to edit by 01/09
- Lab 
    - Inventory post PCR freezers
    - Create an exit google form for the lab to know where peoples samples are and when they can be disposed of

Feb goals: 
- QC_WGS
    - [] Finish Belize extractions (Wait to lib prep until more samples)
    - [] Make Rmd file for lcWGS data analysis 
    - [] Analyze genohub data 
- Octo_Rest
    - [] Submit another draft to Carlos 
    - [] Submit draft to review for a journal?
- TLAP
    - [] Help with modeling 
    - [] Continue reading to fill in gaps in the paper 
- Lab 
    - [] Inventory post PCR freezers
    - [] Create an exit google form for the lab to know where peoples samples are and when they can be disposed of

## <a name="goals"></a> **Daily Logs**

## Feb 29
- MGPR21 2 protein assays 
- Fixed protein plate maps because I did not make them in duplicate form 
- octo_rest writing 

## Feb 27
- Writing for octo_rest 
- Prada lab meeting 
- Prada weekly meeting 
    - QC_WGS
        - Finish extractions for HO and BZ
        - Run dDocent with the published mitochondrial genome mtDNA as a reference genome to see if we got conch reads 
        - Take some of the trimmed fastq files --> FASTA files --> create a bash script to randomly select 10000 reads from 10-12 samples --> Blast against NCBI database
        - Re run dDocent with 2-3 individuals from every pop and build a pseudoreference genome 
    - Octo_rest
        - Cement and epoxy in the discussion 
        - Include pics of corals 
        - Send to Jack to edit by the end of this week 
    - MGPR21
        - Finish proteins by the end of next week (8/3/24)
        - Start looking at chlorophyll protocols so this can get done quicly 

## Feb 26
- QC_WGS extraction for 15 HO_ samples. The extraction went well with a mix of resutls from 30-300 ng/uL. See [extraction log](https://github.com/wdunster/QC_WGS_23/blob/main/QC_WGS_Extraction_Log.md) for details. 
- Finished creating platemaps for MGPR21 protein assays. I will start working on these on Thursday and Friday this week. 

## Feb 20 
- QC_WGS Submitted batch job 303626 - dDocent test run 

## Feb 6 
- Lab meeting - Juliane presents 
- Downloaded QC_WGS sequences from genohub and ran fastp
- URI employee cyber security training
- Prada Meeting
    - QC_WGS
        - Priority = QC on sequences 
        - New samples from Honduras should be extracted early next week 
        - We will probably have to blast our seq against proteins to make sure it is mollusc reads
    - Octo_rest
        - Review Carlos feedback 
        - Create abstract 
        - Send to TL by 2/14 for edits 
    
## Feb 5
- Meeting with Matias to chat about lcWGS analysis 
- Reading for DDocent and lcWGS analysis
