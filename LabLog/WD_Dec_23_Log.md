        - Chemical inventory 


### Dec 11
- QC_WGS FL extraction 16. This went horribly with only 6/21 samples working. I think it might be the RNA Later or the quality of the tissue that FL sent us. Once I had the chloroform, instead of seperating into a distinct aqueous and organic layer, the extraction remains as one sticky mucus layer

### Dec 7 
- QC_WGS PR-F sample cleaning 
- Cleaned lab spaces and tools

### Dec 5 
- QC_WGS lib prep 3 

### Dec 4 
- QC_WGS extraction 13 
- Clean up for 16 Puerto Rico - Fajardo samples 
- Dilution for tomorrows lib prep 
- Prada Meeting
    - QC_WGS
        - Lib  prep tomorrow 
            - FL clean 
            - FL not clean 
            - PR all (F1 and F2 are most important)
            - BVI remaining 
        - Note which samples have mantle from now on 
        - Goal = 10 FL samples extracted by next Tuesday 
    - Personal 
        - Bring up attending Benthics in Jan/Feb 
        - Maybe float the Astrangia conference idea again
